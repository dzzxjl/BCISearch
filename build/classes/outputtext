Abstract The canine <b  class="protein" title="protein">parvovirus NS1 ( CPV2.NS1 ) protein </b>selectively induces apoptosis in the <b  class="cell_type" title="cell_type">malignant cells </b>.<br/>However , for an effective in vivo tumor treatment strategy , an oncolytic agent also needs to induce a potent anti-tumor immune response .<br/>In the present study , we used poly ( I : C ) , a <b  class="protein" title="protein">TLR3 ligand </b>, as an adjuvant along with <b  class="protein" title="protein">CPV2.NS1 </b>to find out if the combination can enhance the oncolytic activity by inducing a potent anti-tumor immune response .<br/>The <b  class="cell_line" title="cell_line">4T1 mammary carcinoma cells </b>were used to induce mammary tumor in Balb mice .<br/>The results suggested that poly ( I : C ) , when given along with <b  class="protein" title="protein">CPV2.NS1 </b>, not only significantly reduced the tumor growth but also augmented the immune response against <b  class="protein" title="protein">tumor antigen </b>( s ) as indicated by the increase in <b  class="cell_type" title="cell_type">blood CD4 + and CD8 + counts </b>and infiltration of <b  class="cell_type" title="cell_type">immune cells </b>in the tumor tissue .<br/>Further , blood serum analysis of the <b  class="protein" title="protein">cytokines </b>revealed that <b  class="protein" title="protein">Th1 cytokines </b>( <b  class="protein" title="protein">IFN-Î ³ </b>and <b  class="protein" title="protein">IL-2 </b>) were significantly upregulated in the treatment group indicating activation of cell-mediated immune response .<br/>The present study reports the efficacy of <b  class="protein" title="protein">CPV2.NS1 </b>along with poly ( I : C ) not only in inhibiting the mammary tumor growth but also in generating an active anti-tumor immune response without any visible toxicity .<br/>The results of our study may help in developing <b  class="protein" title="protein">CPV2.NS1 </b>and poly ( I : C ) combination as a cancer therapeutic regime to treat various malignancies .<br/>KEYWORDS : Anti-tumor immune response ; Apoptosis ; <b  class="protein" title="protein">Breast </b>cancer ; Cancer vaccine adjuvant ; <b  class="DNA" title="DNA">NS1 ; Poly ( I : C ) ; TLR3 </b>.<br/>
